# Made You Look!
This project is an escape room game made in Unity.  I developed it as an independent study during college, and now I'm working on it as one of my company's games.  The title comes from the fact that the player is being forced to look for clues.  
Currently, there are only three playable rooms.  The goal is to find your way out of each room by finding clues.
